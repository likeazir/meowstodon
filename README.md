# Meowstodon

I have no idea what I'm doing.

## Goals
- reaction support
- neon pink theme
- minimum maintenance effort

## Credits
This is mostly not my own work. I just took the features I needed from other forks.

reaction support mainly taken from:
- https://github.com/sk22/megalodon
- https://github.com/LucasGGamerM/moshidon

I wish I could have preserved their commits in the history, but I decided it was too much work to cherry pick commits from two forks that are about a year behind the current upstream (as of decemeber of 2024).
(this is a low effort hobby project)
So i just copy pasted what I needed from https://github.com/LucasGGamerM/moshidon/tree/d81eb6ad0a620f90b5e3181c0223e0b75f683860 and https://github.com/sk22/megalodon/tree/f7dfebcbeacb3db182bdc3b01cf7a1d9cea720ca

neon pink theme inspired by https://git.bsd.gay/fef/nyastodon

the base mastodon android app is developed here: https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-android
